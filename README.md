Chromatic Harmony

Project Overview

Chromatic Harmony is an interactive web application focused on addressing accessibility challenges for users with color vision deficiency (color blindness). It provides a set of tools and live demonstrations to help designers and developers create more inclusive user interfaces.

The app showcases how adaptive UI—using accessible color palettes, textures, and simulation filters—can improve user experience for all.

Core Features

Preset Accessible Palettes: Offers color schemes optimized for Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia. Users can switch palettes in real-time.
Texture Integration: Applies unique patterns (stripes, dots, checkers) to UI elements like buttons and charts, reducing reliance on color alone.
Colorblindness Simulation Filters: Simulates how the interface appears to users with various types of color vision deficiencies, including Achromatopsia.
Interactive Demonstration Area: Showcases dynamic UI components—typography, buttons, alerts, badges, charts—based on selected accessibility settings.
Responsive Control Panel: A sidebar that allows users to change settings such as palettes, textures, and filters in real-time.
